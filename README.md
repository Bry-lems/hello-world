# hello-world
My first repository
I go by the name Bryan, as of 10/05/21 I know very little about what I'm doing. I am currently learning the basics of c++, and getting comfortable with VIM and Linux. I have a few projects in the pipeline to get some practice such as an at home security system with a motion sensing light and camera. I also have a good 'final exam' project to build up my resume that seems a bity scary knowing how little I know about anything I need to know to get it done.
In the wise words of Jake the Dog, “Dude, sucking at sumthin’ is the first step towards being sorta good at something.”
Happy days,
Bry_Lems
