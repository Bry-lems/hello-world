# hello-world
My first repository
I go by the name Bryan, as of 10/05/21 I know very little about what I'm doing on git hub. I am currently learning the basics of c++, while getting comfortable with Git, VIM, and Linux. I have a few projects in the pipeline to get some practice such as an at home security system with a motion sensing light and camera. I also have a good 'final exam' project to build up my resume. As I progress my knowledge, I will use Github as my programming portfolio. 
In the wise words of Jake the Dog, “Dude, sucking at sumthin’ is the first step towards being sorta good at something.”
Happy days,
Bry_Lems
